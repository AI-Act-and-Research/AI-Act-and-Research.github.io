    <h1>Regulation of Foundation Models in the EU AI Act and Research</h1>

    <p>
      AI research is highly collaborative and depends on the ability of the researchers to share and receive trained AI models without interference.
    </p>

<p>In an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u1iXPsgCtog7cvwOejLfSCROGkzEuGk1j7KPZB6SHBU/edit">open letter</a> signed by 150+ PhD and professor level AI researchers, the researchers call for exemption of research and open source from requirements imposed by the AI Act, including for general purpose AI and Foundation Models.</p>

<p>Following the conclusion of the trilogue on 8 December, there is still uncertainty about the extent to which both research and especially open source will be exempt.</p>

<p>Placing burdens for open source and research for sharing models in Europe that go beyond international standards will severely harm or even kill European AI research, as researchers will be unable to use the same models their international competitors can, and may face significant extra burdens when sharing their work.</p>

<p>In the spirit of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u1iXPsgCtog7cvwOejLfSCROGkzEuGk1j7KPZB6SHBU/edit">open letter</a>, we urge the negotiators and decision makers involved with the final stages of the AI Act to not impose any requirements for research and open source that harm the competitiveness of European AI research.</p>
